1) Plug in USB breakout interface
	I needed this to get the NMEA simulator to recognize  a serial port.
2) Connect single jumper wire 
	from USB breakout interface Tx pin to Raspberry Pi Rx pin (GPIO 10)
3) Pi serial port should now be /dev/serial0
4) USB breakout interface should now be /dev/ttyUSB0
5) Run NMEA Simulator Chrome app
	to get: (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nmea-simulator/dfhcgoinjchfcfnnkecjpjcnknlipcll?hl=en)
	In Options -> settings
		select Server
			Set port to /dev/ttyUSB0
			I set Speed to 9600
			I set Data Bits to eight
			I set Parity Bits to no
			I set Stop Bits to one
		Save
	Select Start button.  You should see data changing on GUI
6) Now NMEA 0183 simulated serial data is streaming from /dev/ttyUSB0 into /dev/serial0
7) In Thonny, load simple_serial_with_pynmea4.py file.
	This file will open /dev/serial0 port and start reading lines.
	It looks for any "GGA" NMEA sentences
	When a GGA sentence is found, it parses it with pynmea2 and prints to Thonny shell
		Note: To get pynmea2 to run without error, I had to run:
			python3 -m pip install pynmea2
			This installed pynmea2 in the python3 path.
