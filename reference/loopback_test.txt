	Loopback test
	
	Steps I used to perform loopback on USB port of Raspberry Pi

1) Found USB breakout interface.  (Used from ESP-01 programmer)
	a) https://www.electroschematics.com/the-mighty-esp-01-adapter/
2) Shorted Tx to RX with jumper wire
3) On Pi
	a) Find what serial port are in use before plugging in USB loopback
	b) dmesg | grep tty.  This will show existing used tty ports.
	c) Now plug in usb breakout interface.  This can be done powered.
	d) dmesg | grep tty.  You should now see a new tty port being used.  I saw ttyUSB0
	e) install minicom.  sudo apt-get install minicom lsof
	e) invoke  minicom with -s option.  sudo minicom -s
		1) arrow down to select "serial port setup"
			i) select A - serial device
			ii) change /dev/ttyxxx to /dev/ttyUSB0 
			iii) cr
			iv) exit
		2) you are now in minicom and can see the port is ttyUSB0.
			i) start typing.  You should see your keys echoed on the screen.
			ii) CTRL -A Q, yes to exit.
